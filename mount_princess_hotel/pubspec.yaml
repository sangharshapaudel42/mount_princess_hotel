  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  # -family: Roboto
  #   fonts:
  #     - asset: Roboto-BlackItalic.ttf
  #       weight: 900
  #       style: italic
  # - family: Roboto
  #   fonts:
  #     - asset: fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
  #       # - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #       weight: 200
